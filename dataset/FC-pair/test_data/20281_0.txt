The reasoning behind this method to get a random number is, because I'm not
displaying the current number of players, no one should know who the 11th player
will be, and that should be random enough to prevent anyone from cheating the system.
The reward is only 1 ether so it's low enough that miners won't try to influence it
... i hope.
