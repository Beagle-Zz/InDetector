     * - name must be unique
     * - names will be converted to lowercase
     * - name cannot start or end with a space

     * - cannot be only numbers
     * - cannot start with 0x
     * - name must be at least 1 char
     * - max length of 32 characters long
     * - allowed characters: a-z, 0-9, and space
